This project explores customer preferences for self-driving car features using conjoint analysis.
Our results found that comfort, connectivity, and energy efficiency drive customer preferences,

proposed products and benchmarked them against current offerings from Tesla and Hyundai based
on the data available, providing recommendations to optimize product design and positioning to
maximize profit.
